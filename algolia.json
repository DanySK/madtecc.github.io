Next-generation intelligent pervasive systems will be modelled as digital twins that are counterparts of physical objects and executed in parallel. Moreover, combining the mirroring of the physical entities \u0026ndash; that allows for continuous observation of the real world and the corresponding update of the digital replica \u0026ndash; with computational intelligence enables the individual devices to operate responsibly towards their goals.","tags":null,"title":"Call for papers","type":"post","url":"/cfp/","weight":0,"wordcount":574},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"The call for papers is out","date":1654992000,"description":"The call for papers is out","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"The call for papers is out","excerpt_text":"The call for papers is out","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"html":"The call for papers is out","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654992000,"objectID":"739fad96c689c53f9d102facd0b58a99","permalink":"https://madtecc.github.io/organization/","publishdate":"2022-06-12T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/organization/","section":"post","summary":"Committees Organising Committee Lukas Esterkle: Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Aarhus University, Denmark\nSara Montagna, Department of Pure and Applied Science - University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Italy\nDanilo Pianini, Department of Computer Science and Engineering - University of Bologna, Italy\nProgram Committee Ginaluca Aguzzi, University of Bologna, Italy Kirstie Bellman, TopcyHouse Consulting, USA Giovanni Ciatto, University of Bologna, Italy Chiara Contoli, University of Urbino, Italy Matteo Donati, University of Urbino, Italy Stefano Mariani, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy Amir M.","tags":null,"title":"Organization","type":"post","url":"/organization/","weight":0,"wordcount":110},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"about/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://madtecc.github.io/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"The 22nd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom 2024) March 11-15, 2024 in Biarritz, France.
