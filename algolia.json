Conference Overview Recent trends in computer science promoted new ways to think about software at both design time and run time. Next-generation intelligent pervasive systems will be modelled as digital twins that are counterparts of physical objects and executed in parallel. Moreover, combining the mirroring of the physical entities \u0026ndash; that allows for continuous observation of the real world and the corresponding update of the digital replica \u0026ndash; with computational intelligence enables the individual devices to operate responsibly towards their goals.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page","url":"/","weight":0,"wordcount":482}]
