      <description>Recent trends in computer science promoted new ways to think about software at both design time and run time. Next-generation intelligent pervasive systems will be modelled as digital twins that are counterparts of physical objects and executed in parallel. Moreover, combining the mirroring of the physical entities &amp;ndash; that allows for continuous observation of the real world and the corresponding update of the digital replica &amp;ndash; with computational intelligence enables the individual devices to operate responsibly towards their goals.</description>
